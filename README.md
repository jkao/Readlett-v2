Mediac
---

I built Mediac to deal with saving my bookmarks that changed (i.e. -
comics) and as a way to learn Rails 3. 

Has things like Omniauth and some web-scraping gems, so it might be
useful for some folks who need a reference.

The code's messy (back when I was starting learning Rails), but you should be able to deploy to Heroku just fine.

**TODO**: 
- Clean up code
- Clean up keys (unused, so it's not really be a security issue)
